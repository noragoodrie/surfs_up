# SURFS_UP

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

The project at hand was brought to us by W.Avy. A man who needs our help analyzing temperature trends before he allows himself to open a surf and ice-cream shop in beautiful Oahu, Hawaii. The main agenda we had was to see the temperature trends in the months of June and December and to see if this business can survive all year long! Will this business be sustainable year-round? Check below to see our results!

**RESULTS**

JUNE TEMPATURE

-	The temperature low in June is 64 degrees, while the high is 85 degrees.
-	We can see that the average temperature in June is around 75 degrees.
-	
-	Season: Summer

**SUMMARY/CONCLUSION**

We can easily say that with the temperature trends W.Avy will be able to sustain his business for the whole year. The difference between temperatures in the Summer compared to the Winter season is not drastic, it is a 4-degree difference between the average temperatures. 

Sadly, we know we know we need to provide him with more information for him to make the right decision. There are more factors than just temperature. We would need to query precipitation between the two months as well as tsunamis and other weather trends. Hawaii is know to be warm all year long, but it is also known to storm and rain significantly all year long which means people may not be surfing during those times, but that doesn’t mean they won’t be eating Ice-Cream! It is safe to say with the information we have provided within temperature trends that W.Avy will be just fine with his business all year long.
